# Challenge 3

## Starting material:

CSS media queries are great when we are creating a responsive web design but sometimes, we need to apply same media queries in the Javascript side like "isDesktop ? use Header component else use HamburgerMenu"

## Startup

- Copy `00-start` project folder.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start` and implement the challenge.

## Tips

A. Play with component feeding `showMenu` props equals true / false.

B. Create `useMediaQuery` hook. You can use [matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) Javascript method to check if the document matches the media query.
