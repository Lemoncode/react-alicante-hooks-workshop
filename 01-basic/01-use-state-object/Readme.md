# 02 Use State Object

In the previous sample we learnt how to make use of _useState_ to add state
to a functional component. We just added a simple field (string), but what
if we want to useState on an object? What is the equivalent to class
component based _SetState_? Your friend spread operator :), let's hop on that.

# Steps

- We will take as starting point sample _00-use-state. Copy the content of the
  project to a fresh folder an execute \_npm install_.

```bash
npm install
```

- Let's open the _demo.js_ file and add our hooks based state.

_./src/demo.js_

```diff
import React from "react";

export const MyComponent = props => {
-  const [myName, setMyName] = React.useState("John Doe");
+    const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = React.useState({
+       name: 'John',
+       lastname: 'Doe',
+    });

  return (
    <>
-      <h4>{myName}</h4>
+      <h4>{userInfo.name} {userInfo.lastname}</h4>

-      <input value={myName} onChange={e => setMyName(e.target.value)} />
+            <input
+                value={userInfo.name}
+                onChange={(e) => setUserInfo({
+                   ...userInfo,
+                    name: e.target.value
+                })}
+            />
+            <input
+                value={userInfo.lastname}
+                onChange={(e) => setUserInfo({
+                    ...userInfo,
+                    lastname: e.target.value
+                })}
+            />
+        </>
    </>
  );
};
```

- Now if you run the sample you can check that you can update both properties
  _name_ and _lastname_, you can easily assign an object to useState, and in order
  to update it you can just make use of the _spread operator_ instead of using
  _setState_.
