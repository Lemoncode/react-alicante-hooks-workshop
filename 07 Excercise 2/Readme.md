# Challenge 2

## Starting material:

In a previous example, we just saw how to filter a list of users server from a rest-api listening to an input onChange event.

This is not optimal, shouldn't it be cool to wait a bit til the user is not typing for some milisseconds in order to fire the server request?

## Startup

- Copy `00-start` project folder.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start` and implement the challenge.

## Tips

A. You can try to build something like that by yourself (nice excercise).

B. Read from blog post and check if the solutions was similar like your proposal: [https://dev.to/gabe_ragland/debouncing-with-react-hooks-jci](https://dev.to/gabe_ragland/debouncing-with-react-hooks-jci)

C. Use an already made hook: [https://github.com/xnimorz/use-debounce](https://github.com/xnimorz/use-debounce)
